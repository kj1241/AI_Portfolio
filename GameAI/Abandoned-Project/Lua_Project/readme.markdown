## Rock Scissors Paper Game - Lua Script and C++ AI Project

### Key Points Covered:
- **RockScissorsPaper**

### Description:

In this project, I developed a "Rock Scissors Paper" game using Lua Script and C++. 
The AI makes a random choice between rock, paper, or scissors, and the player competes against it. 
This project, created during my university studies, demonstrates how Lua scripting can be integrated with C++ for dynamic game development and AI functionalities.

## Final Project(RPG) - Lua Script and C++ AI Project

### Key Points Covered:
- **FinalProject**

### Description:

In this final project for a game AI course, I created an RPG game using Lua Script and C++. 
The game involves battling goblins, using items to heal, and striving to defeat all enemies. 
Lua Script handles the core game logic, while C++ manages game execution and user interaction.
